# DMU Students Central
I would like to mention that previously I was working on a porfolio project. <link here> I changed my mind due to the high number of other students 
doing the same project. 

1. ## About this website

This website is going to be a central place where DMU students can find lots of interesting things:
Including:
-Information
-Advice
-Campus map -with details
-And other interesting local events - ie places to go for fun and eat.

2. ## Codeing Language
I will be using compination of HTLM5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT E6

3. ## Design platforms
-Starting with the prototype -scatches on paper -This will keep changing from time to time
-Interms of software, I will be using just text editor - Notepadd++
-Similarly, the editing tools provided by Google chrome browser

4. ## Testing
-testing on different browsers, chrome, explorer and firefox
-using chrome browser device inspection tools for different screen sizes
-will be asking friends and famlity to navigate and improve upon feedback

## Critical review:
Problems when developing the site that I came accross were:
- website not being responsive although I used all the breakpoints correctly. Apparently, it worked by resizing the browser window but not
when using chrome responsive tool nor did it work on tried Andriod and iphone smartphones.
### how did I overcame this problem
-well I tried many things but ended up using rows and colums for the main content area.
