First of all, I would like to mention that previously I was working on a portfolio project. see link --> (https://github.com/Somboy/Portfolio). 
I changed my mind due to the high number of other students doing the same project as well as me wanting to do something different and more challenging.

1. ## Brief description:
I am naming the website as StudentsCentral. This website is going to be a central place where DMU students can find lots of interesting things:
such as:
* Information
* Advice
* Campus map -with details
* And other interesting local events - i.e places to go for fun and eat.

2. ## Design
* ### Wire-frame:
This is the blueprint of my website design - shows how I am going to arrange elements. On top, I will have navigation menus, followed by banner image(slideshow imgs). In the middle of the page is where I will put all the important contents.
Below is an image of my initial design.

* ### Prototype:
I have used Microsoft office Powerpoint software - shape tools to draw a sketches of the website. This helped me to determine the actual look of the website and the information I should include especially on different devices. My approach was mobile first as the project requirement. Below are images of the website prototype showing how the website will look like on mobile first, then tablet, then laptop/desktop and large screen sizes. 
##### Mobile View

3. ## Development Process
* ### coding language:
I will be using combination of HTLM5, CSS3, and JAVASCRIPT E6

* ### Software platform:
-In-terms of software, I will be using just text editor - Notepadd++
-Similarly, the editing tools provided by Google chrome browser

4. ## Testing
* ### Responsive tests
  1. browsers: Tested on all major browsers including chrome, Internet explorer, and Firefox.

  3. user experience: colleagues and family members to navigate and give feedback for accessibility.
Asked three of university colleagues to navigate and usability test my website. Similarly, two of my family members have used it and the feedback was really good. I have made changes to their suggestions such as moving social media links from the middle to the bottom of the website.   
* ### code validation: used W3schools website to validate html5 and css
I used w3schools code validation tools. fixed all of the errors that came up and my code has finally been successful. However, some warnings are detected such as missing h2 which i don't want to include. See results below.
###html validation

5. ## Critical review:
Problems when developing the site that I came across were:
* website not being responsive although I used all the breakpoints correctly. Apparently, it worked by resizing the browser window but not
when using chrome responsive tool nor did it work on tried Android and iPhone smart-phones.
-]how did I overcame this problem -well I tried many things but ended up using rows and columns for the main content area.
* another problem was images not loading up on Github, In the console I was getting errors saying that browser couldn't load the images with error 41
-]how did I overcame this problem - After some Google searches I surprisingly found that those images which are not loading where .jpg file formats. I changed them to .png and problem solved.
* The last major issue was that of the Google map not loading. worked fine on local but problem was when uploaded to Github.
-] Took me sometime but at the end the solution was setting up api key correctly. see the steps below.
